## Summary

Pregabalin, modafinil and piracetam each have well-characterized pharmacokinetics but distinct subjective effects. Pregabalin (Lyrica) is a CNS depressant (sedative/anxiolytic); modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting stimulant; piracetam is a "nootropic" with mild cognitive/energy effects. Below are detailed tables and timelines for each drug, combining clinical (half‑life, metabolism, dosing) and anecdotal reports (high-dose effects, subjective onset/peak/duration). Finally, a conceptual combined timeline illustrates the net sedation–alertness profile if all three are taken simultaneously (300 mg pregabalin + 200 mg modafinil + 2.4 g piracetam at time 0 by a healthy male with slight tolerance). All data points are sourced to clinical references and user reports where available.

## Pregabalin (Lyrica)

| Parameter                    | Value / Range                                           | Source                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elimination half-life        | ~4.5–7 hours (mean ~6.3 h)                              | Clinical studies                                                      |
| Excretion                    | ~90% unchanged in urine (renal clearance ~67–81 mL/min) | Primarily renal (unchanged drug)                                      |
| Time to peak (Tmax)          | ~1.5 h (fast absorption)                                | Pharmacokinetic data (fast, food-independent)                         |
| Typical dose                 | 150–450 mg/day (divided)                                | FDA-approved dosing                                                   |
| Max recommended dose         | 600 mg/day (IR)                                         | FDA limit; higher doses yield more adverse effects                    |
| High-dose reports            | Anecdotal up to 1,200 mg/day or more                    | Erowid/Bluelight reports: euphoria/sedation at 600–1200 mg            |
| Onset of subjective effects  | ~30–60 min (some sedation/anxiolysis)                   | Clinical peak at 1.5 h, users report onset ~1 h                       |
| Peak subjective effects      | ~1–2 hours (sedation/dreaminess)                        | Matches Tmax; users note peak euphoria/sedation by 1–2 h at high dose |
| Duration of effects          | ~6–8 hours (notable sedation/anxiolysis)                | Half-life ~6 h, effects wane by 8–12 h                                |
| Excretion time (elimination) | ~5 half-lives ≈30–40 h (to negligible levels)           | ~5×t1/2 for ≈97% elimination                                          |

**Notes:** Pregabalin's effects include sedation, anxiolysis and mild euphoria at higher doses. One user reported taking ~1050–1200 mg over 5 hours, feeling "loose" but still functional. Another noted 300 mg caused drowsiness and cognitive blurring. Tolerance often develops to euphoria, so some self-titers exceed 600 mg. Pregabalin's C_max occurs ~1.5 h post-dose, consistent with onset ~1 h and peak ~1–2 h in reports. Effects generally wane after ~6–8 h, matching its ~6 h half-life.

## Modafinil (Provigil)

| Parameter                   | Value / Range                                          | Source                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Elimination half-life       | ~12–15 hours (R-modafinil ~10–17 h)                    | Pharmacokinetic studies                                                        |
| Excretion                   | ~80% urine (mostly inactive metabolite modafinil acid) | Primarily hepatic metabolism; metabolites via urine                            |
| Time to peak (Tmax)         | ~2–4 h                                                 | Clinical data (peak concentrations ~2–4 h after dose)                          |
| Duration of action          | ~10–12 h (therapeutic effect)                          | Wakefulness effect ~half-life; referenced as ~11.5 h                           |
| Typical dose                | 100–200 mg once daily                                  | Standard medical dose                                                          |
| Max recommended dose        | 400 mg/day (acute studies; no added benefit >200)      | Up to 400 mg tolerated in narcolepsy studies; higher tends to add side effects |
| High-dose reports           | Occasional off-label use 400–600 mg/day                | Some patients on 400 mg; rare reports of 600+ mg                               |
| Onset of subjective effects | ~30–60 min (alertness increase)                        | Generally felt within 1 h; matches pharmacokinetics                            |
| Peak subjective effects     | ~2–4 hours (maximum alertness, focus)                  | Aligns with Tmax; moderate cognitive enhancement and wakefulness reported      |
| Duration of effects         | ~10–15 hours (carryover alertness)                     | Consistent with long half-life; some lingering effect up to ~12–15 h           |
| Excretion time              | ~5 half-lives ≈60–75 h (~3 days)                       | ~5×t1/2 for near complete elimination                                          |

**Notes:** Modafinil promotes alertness and wakefulness without classic stimulant euphoria. It peaks slowly (~2–4 h) and lasts long (effects up to ~12 h). Clinical dosing is 100–200 mg, but studies show 400 mg/day is "well-tolerated" though with no extra benefit. A Bluelight user cautions "wouldn't take more than 400 mg at a time". Narcolepsy communities occasionally mention up to 600 mg/day or more, often with diminishing returns and some side effects (headache, irritability). Onset is within ~1 h, with focus/energy peaking ~2–3 h post-dose; effects persist through the day consistent with its long half-life.

## Piracetam

| Parameter                   | Value / Range                                 | Source                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Elimination half-life       | ~4–5 hours                                    | Clinical pharmacokinetic data                                            |
| Excretion                   | ~85–95% unchanged in urine                    | Renal excretion of unchanged drug                                        |
| Time to peak (Tmax)         | ~0.5–1.5 h                                    | "Peak plasma ~30–90 min after ingestion"                                 |
| Typical dose                | 1,200–4,800 mg/day (in 2–3 doses)             | Common nootropic dosing range                                            |
| High-dose reports           | 7–24 g/day (wide individual variation)        | Neurological use: 7–24 g/day dose-dependent; up to 45 g in special cases |
| Onset of subjective effects | ~30–60 min (subtle cognition/energy)          | Rapid absorption; users report mild lift                                 |
| Peak subjective effects     | ~1–2 hours (max cognitive/nootropic effect)   | Matches Tmax; some report sharper memory/alertness                       |
| Duration of effects         | ~4–6 hours (effects taper as drug is cleared) | Half-life 4–5 h, so most effect gone by ~6 h                             |
| Excretion time              | ~5 half-lives ≈20–25 h (nearly complete)      | ~5×t1/2 ~1 day                                                           |

**Notes:** Piracetam is a "racetam" nootropic, often taken in multi-gram doses. Clinically, doses of 7–24 g/day are used for cognitive disorders, and patients tolerated up to 45 g/day with notable benefits and minimal side effects. Among nootropic users, typical "supplement" doses are 1.6–4.8 g daily (divided), though some self-experiment with 6–10 g at once. Piracetam acts quickly (peak ~1 h), with subjective reports of increased mental clarity or mild stimulation rather than sedation. Effects generally last 4–6 h before declining as piracetam is eliminated (half-life ~5 h). Tolerance is reported low; side effects (headache, insomnia) are rare.

## Individual Effect Timelines (at High Dose)

Based on the above data and high-dose reports, a typical timeline (onset, peak, offset) for each drug at near-maximal dose might be:

- **Pregabalin (~600–1,000 mg):** Onset ~0.5–1 h; peak sedation/euphoria at ~1–2 h; effects (sedation, anxiolysis) diminish by ~6–8 h post-dose. Memory/blunting effects can be notable at doses ≥600 mg.
- **Modafinil (200–400 mg):** Onset ~0.5–1 h; peak alertness/energy at ~2–3 h; substantial effect lasts ~10–12 h (full day). Cognitive enhancement/attention boost dissipates by ~12–15 h.
- **Piracetam (2,400–10,000+ mg):** Onset ~0.5 h; peak mild cognitive enhancement ~1–2 h; effects taper off by ~4–6 h. (Diminishing returns noted at very high doses; side effects minimal.)

These are idealized for a "max dose" scenario; real experiences vary. For example, one user on 4800 mg/day reported noticeable cognitive lift by day 3. Another experimenter took 4.8 g daily for 3 days, then 2.4 g split doses, noting enhanced mood/energy.

## Combined Effects (Three-Drug Timeline)

When all three are taken together (e.g. 300 mg pregabalin + 200 mg modafinil + 2.4 g piracetam at time 0), their effects overlap. Conceptually (see chart below), the alertness vs. time curve might look like this for a tolerant healthy male:

- **0–0.5 h:** All drugs are being absorbed. Minimal change from baseline.
- **0.5–1 h:** Onset – Pregabalin sedation begins; modafinil and piracetam start increasing alertness. Net: near baseline or very mild sedation.
- **1–2 h:** Rising – Pregabalin approaches peak sedation (~1–2 h), modafinil and piracetam reach ~peak alertness. Net effect: slight positive alertness as stimulant effects slightly outweigh sedation around 2 h.
- **2–4 h:** Peak net alertness – Modafinil is near max (≈8–10 hours into wakefulness), piracetam effect wanes (~half by 4 h), pregabalin sedation tapers. Combined alertness is highest in this window.
- **4–8 h:** Decline – Piracetam mostly worn off, modafinil still active (though slowly declining), pregabalin sedation diminishes to baseline by ~8 h. Net state: moderate alertness from lingering modafinil.
- **8–12 h:** Waning – Modafinil gradually fades (half-life ~12–15 h); minimal pregabalin/piracetam effects remain. Alertness gradually returns toward baseline.
- **Beyond 12 h:** Alertness approaches normal as all three drugs clear (~1–2 days total for full elimination of modafinil).

## Subjective Experience and Practical Applications

### What Users Would Feel

The combined experience of this three-drug cocktail creates a unique psychoactive profile that evolves throughout the day:

**Early Phase (0-2 hours):**

- Initial mild relaxation and anxiety reduction from pregabalin onset
- Gradual emergence of mental clarity and subtle energy from piracetam
- Building alertness as modafinil begins to take effect
- Overall feeling of "calm focus" - relaxed but increasingly alert

**Peak Phase (2-4 hours):**

- Optimal cognitive state: alert, focused, and anxiety-free
- Enhanced working memory and mental processing from piracetam
- Sustained wakefulness and motivation from modafinil
- Reduced social anxiety and disinhibition from pregabalin
- Potential mild euphoria without jitteriness or overstimulation

**Decline Phase (4-8 hours):**

- Sustained alertness and focus as modafinil remains active
- Piracetam effects fade, reducing cognitive enhancement
- Pregabalin sedation diminishes, anxiety may gradually return
- Overall state remains functional and productive

**Late Phase (8+ hours):**

- Gradual return to baseline as all effects wane
- Potential for mild fatigue as the body processes the combination
- Sleep may be affected due to modafinil's long duration

### Potential Use Cases

This combination might be particularly useful for:

**Professional/Academic Applications:**

- Long study sessions requiring sustained focus with minimal anxiety
- High-pressure presentations or meetings where calm confidence is needed
- Creative work requiring both analytical thinking and reduced inhibition
- All-day work sessions requiring consistent alertness without crashes

**Social Applications:**

- Social situations requiring both mental sharpness and reduced anxiety
- Networking events or conferences where sustained energy and sociability are needed
- Public speaking or performance situations

**Therapeutic Considerations:**

- Managing conditions where both cognitive enhancement and anxiety reduction are desired
- Situations requiring wakefulness despite underlying fatigue or depression
- Transition periods where multiple symptoms need addressing simultaneously

### Important Considerations

**Risks and Limitations:**

- Complex drug interactions and unpredictable individual responses
- Potential for tolerance development, particularly to pregabalin's euphoric effects
- Sleep disruption from long-acting modafinil
- Cognitive impairment from pregabalin may counteract nootropic effects at higher doses
- Risk of dependence, especially with regular pregabalin use

**Optimal Timing:**

- Best taken early morning (6-8 AM) to avoid sleep interference
- Not suitable for evening use due to modafinil's long duration
- Effects may vary significantly based on food intake, hydration, and individual metabolism

This combination essentially creates a "functional stimulation" profile - providing energy and focus while minimizing anxiety and overstimulation, making it potentially useful for demanding cognitive tasks in anxiety-provoking situations.
